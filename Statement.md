They also lack clear insight into where their money is actually going .<br>

# |Scope  of the Project|
This project is limited to a Command Line Interface (CLI).<br>
The scope of the Expense Tracker program is intentionally narrow, focusing on immediate, in-memory financial tracking for a single user over a defined monthly period.<br>
**--In Scope:** Adding expenses, updating budget, days advancement and printing expense chart at any point.<br>
**--Out of Scope:** Graphical User Interface (GUI), reminders of too much spending or reaching end of budget, date persistence, advance date and time function adn multi user collaboration.<br>

# |Target Users|
**-Developers:** Users who prefer staying in the terminal environment.<br>
**-Students:** Those learning basics of python and wants to make an difficults code with basics command.<br>

# |High level Features|
**Menu System:** To make the End User down categories to work with as per his preference.<br>
**--Budget Setting and Real-Time Tracking:** The ability to set an initial monthly budget and automatically calculate and display the remaining balance after every transaction.<br>
